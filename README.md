# Assembler
***Assembler*** is a Grasshopper plugin that helps you create and manage *assemblages* of parts, conceived with (but not limited to) the architectural scale in mind.

With ***Assembler***, you can create assemblages from parts and rules for their connection, manage the criteria for the assemblage growth and its interaction with environmental geometries and data, and perform local (part) and global (assemblage) level computation on the results for analysis or post-processing.

## Installation instructions
Install ***Assembler*** via Rhino Package Manager.

## Note about crediting and NFTs:

- I am for fair compensation of artist for their contribution to privates and community alike, but I am personally ***against*** NFTs. I don't think they are an answer, and I find the idea of purposely creating artificial scarcity to make value ***perverse***. If that wasn't enough, they're a [giant money-laundering pyramid scheme](https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1445795667826208770) and create structural incentives for [theft](https://twitter.com/NFTtheft) in the open source and generative art communities. Their [environmental impact](https://earth.org/nfts-environmental-impact/), although it can be mitigated, is also a huge issue. The lack of current viable alternatives to compensate artists is no excuse for the use of this garbage pile.
- **I do not authorize in any way this project to be used for selling NFTs**, although I cannot legally enforce it. **Respect the creator**.
