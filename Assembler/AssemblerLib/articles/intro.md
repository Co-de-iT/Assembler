# What is *Assembler*?
<br>

**Assembler** is a Grasshopper plugin that helps you construct and manage *assemblages* of parts, conceived with (but not limited to) the architectural scale in mind.

With ***Assembler***, you can create assemblages from parts and rules for their connection, manage the criteria for the assemblage growth and its interaction with environmental geometries and data, and perform local (part) and global (assemblage) level computation on the results for analysis or post-processing.
