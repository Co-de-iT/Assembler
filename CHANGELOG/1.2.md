# 1.2 Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2023-01-06
### Added
#### Plugin
- <u>_Weights are now active_</u>: in case of equal computed value for two or more candidates, a factor consisting of the sum of AssemblyObject, Handle and Rule weight is compared, highest weight prevails. Examples files are provided in folder _04 - expert_.
- The **_HeuristicsDisplay_** component now has proper rendered geometries when Rhino view is in Rendered mode; it can also bake Collision Meshes, rules texts and XData geometries in dedicated Layers
- **_AssemblyObjects_** can now be cast directly into the following types (using this field/property):
    - Mesh (Collision Mesh)
    - Plane (Reference Plane)
    - Point (Reference Plane Origin)
    - Vector (Direction)
    - Number (Weight)
    - Integer (Type)
    - Boolean (World Z-lock status)

    **NOTE**: due to the Grasshopper default casting overhead, using the Post-Processing Extract components is faster than casting as the amount of AssemblyObjects grows

### Changed
#### Plugin
- **_ExtractHandles_** now exposes the following additional outputs:
    - Handle occupancy
    - neighbour Object index
    - neighbour Handle index
- **_DisplayAssemblage_** now exposes an additional output for values computed to generate colors in the following modes:
    - Z value
    - Connectedness
    - Local Density
- <u>_default weight for Rules is now 1_</u> (previously was 0): this is for better coherence (it aligns with default weights for AssemblyObjects and Handles) and to implement weight-based strategies (see **Added** section)
- **_AssemblyObject_** preview now includes Handles (different color for each type) and Direction Vector
- baking an **_AssemblyObject_** will bake the Collision Mesh ad L polylines for its Reference Plane and each of its Handles
#### AssemblerLib
- some **_AssemblerLib_** classes fields converted, more appropriately, into Properties, and some name changes occurred for the sake of clarity
<u>**WARNING**</u>: the above might break custom scripts (sorry about this, but... hey, it's for the greater good!) - check your scripts after updating, it might be just an Uppercase difference in the property name
- sparse refactoring to improve readability here and there

### Deprecated
#### Plugin
- Old version of the changed components will appear with the "OLD" watermark in preexisting definitions
#### AssemblerLib
- _**Utilities**_ class is deprecated (too big). Methods have moved to specific classes in the namespace _**AssemblerLib.Utils**_

### Removed

### Fixed
#### Plugin
- weird fringe case behavior of **_ExogenousSettings_** component that caused preview issues when opening a file where component was disabled
- bad behavior of the **_ExogenousSettings_** component when no Meshes were present in the Environment Meshes input (Exogenous Settings were null, causing the Engine to throw an error)
- bug that caused preview issues when Handle type was out of the range 0-23
- bug that provoked an error in the **_AssemblerEngine_** when an Assemblage could not develop when out of Field (this did not affect the resulting Assemblage, but having the Engine flashing red was bad form)
- bug on the Occupancy Display Mode in **_DisplayAssemblage_**
- error in the **_DeconstructField_** component throwing an error when deconstructing sparse Fields
- improved error trapping messages on several components, especially in the **_AssemblerEngine_**
#### AssemblerLib
- errors in several *_Utilities.Clone_* overrides and *_Utilities.RemoveAssemblyObject_* method that caused malfunctions in the **_RemoveAssemblyObject_** component
