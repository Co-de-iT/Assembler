# 1.3 Changelog

## [1.3.0] - 2025-05-XX
- **_Rhino 8 update version_**: plugin and examples have been tested on Rhino 8 SR16, latest stable version to this day
### Added
#### components
- new components in the **_Engine_** section: **_Assembler Setup_**,  **_CloneAssemblage_**, **_Assembler Select Receiver_**, **_Assembler Select Sender_**. These components are intended to improve modularity and work with explicit iterative processes (using the Anemone or Hoopsnake plugin), using custom strategies to compute receiver and sender values during the assemblage
- new **_AOSet from AssemblyObject List_** component, that can extract the set of unique AssemblyObject kinds used in a given list (useful when loading AssemblyObjects from file)
- new **_Construct Field from Resolution_** component, that constructs an empty field with points at a given resolution (distance) in XYZ directions
- new **_Debug Display_** component, that displays in-place info for AssemblyObjects in an Assemblage, such as AO index, type, weight, rule, and Handle occupancy, type, weight. Info can be displayed for the whole Assemblage or a selection of AssemblyObjects.
#### other
- **_Handle_** type:
     - has a new **_Occupancy_** value available (**_2 - Contact_**): this value is used to register "secondary" connections (Handle-to-Handle connection happening during the assemblage, not caused by a rule). In previous versions, these were counted as connections (1); with this differentiation, users can distinguish the connection type and act accordingly
     - has a new **_RotationIndex_** field to record the rotation when used as a receiver (default value is -1)
- example files for iterative engine with Anemone and Hoopsnake plugins
- example files for better interaction with Rhino objects User Text metadata, such as direct creation of AssemblyObjects from a Rhino file
- Grasshopper RCP (Remote Control Panel): several examples use the RCP for easier operation and user-interfacing
### Changed
#### components
- **_AssemblerEngine_** component has no more setup inputs (moved to the **_Assembler Setup_** component), for overall improved modularity and better clarity
- changes in several fields/properties names and method signatures in **_AssemblerLib.dll_** for better consistency and intuitive understanding
- **_ConstructAssemblyObject_** component: World Z-Lock option has been moved from the component context menu to an input option, to enhance usability and automatization
- **_DeconstructAssembage_** component: rules and receiver index outputs now have respectively empty and -1 outputs for the AssemblyObjects used to start the Assemblage. This change is made to have DataTrees of equal number of branches in output, not just matching indexes.
- **_DeconstructAssemblyObject_** component: outputs have been re-ordered for coherence; Receiver and Sender values outputs have been added
- **_DisplayAssemblage_** component: display modes have been moved from the component context menu to an input option, to enhance usability and automatization
- **_DisplayHandle_** component: Handle types are now colored, and a triangular flag hepls identifying the Handle Plane orientation
- **_ExogenousSettings_** component: the "Use Container" option has been moved from the component context menu to an input option, to enhance usability and automatization
- **_HeuristicsDisplay_** component:
     - has new inputs (Base Plane and Orientation Plane) and can output the coherence pattern to cull invalid rules; Base Plane replaces the Base Point input with the orientation plane for the whole matrix of rules, the Orientation Plane is used to orient the individual AssemblyObjects couples for each rule. For instance, this can be used to visualize a table of axonometric results of all rules while in a view aligend with the Base Plane (see example files for that).
     - has a new Context menu option for displaying connecting Handles involved in each Rule (see documentation for details)
- **_HeuristicsDisplayEx_** component has new inputs (Base Plane): it replaces the Base Point input with the orientation plane for the whole matrix of rules.
- the **_ResetAssemblyObject_** component now has the options to selectively reset receiver value, sender value and/or occupancy status
#### other
- several refactoring and optimization-related changes to the code under the hood, to improve modularity, maintenance, performance and clarity - see the AssemblerLib documentation for changes to the exposed classes and methods
- example files have been revisited and enhanced to improve the learning curve and expand the use-cases
- the scripted examples have been refactored for clarity and readability as well
- revamped icon set: the new icons should enhance usability, individuation, categorization and look better in general
### Deprecated
- **_AssemblerEngine_** old version that included both setup and engine
- some exposed methods in AssemblerLib.dll (see library documentation)  

### Removed
- all the methods in the deprecated static **_Utilities_** class of **_AssemblerLib.dll_**
### Fixed
- **_Heuristics Display_** component rendered preview problem in Rhino 8 (fixed using Rhino 8 SR 8 or later)
